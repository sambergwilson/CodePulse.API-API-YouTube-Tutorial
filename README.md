# CodePulse.API-API-YouTube-Tutorial

This marks my venture into API development, an experience that proved instrumental in grasping the utility of APIs and the significance of maintaining a well-organized code structure.

As a newer developer, comprehending the rationale behind extensive folder separation and data maneuvering across numerous files and interfaces can be challenging. This project has significantly enhanced my understanding, emphasizing how the segregation or decoupling of code can simplify updates or refactoring, reducing the complexity from managing multiple locations to a more manageable scope.

I must clarify that I take no credit for constructing this API independently; however, I find it worthwhile to share this learning journey as it has contributed substantially to my programming education.

## Learning More About API's: How to Create and Utilize Them

Tools employed to navigate and construct this API include:
- C# ASP.Net
- SwaggerUI
- The YouTube video itself: [CodePulse API Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNVbiIsoEUw&t=5041s) (Appreciation to Sameer Saini for the valuable free content)
- Entity Framework
- SQL Server Management Studio

Additionally, I utilized the course [Real World App - Angular, ASP.NET Core Web API, and SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-app-angular-aspnet-core-web-api-and-sql/?couponCode=NOV2023) during the development process, particularly during the challenging phase of implementing the UpdatePart functionality.

### Areas for Future Development:

1. Connecting to a Front End
2. Completing the Blogs.cs Implementation
3. Continuous Practice to Enhance Proficiency

Your constructive feedback and suggestions are welcome as I embark on refining and expanding my skills in the realm of programming.
